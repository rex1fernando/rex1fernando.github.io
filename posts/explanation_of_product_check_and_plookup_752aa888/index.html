    <h1>Explanation of Product Check and Plookup</h1>

    

    <h2 id="product-check">Product Check</h2>
<p>The main building block for Plookup is the Product Check. Assume you have
a finite prime-order field $\newcommand{\F}{\mathbb{F}}\F = \F_q$,
a polynomial commitment $\newcommand{\com}{\mathsf{com}}\com(f)$ for some
polynomial $f \in \F[X]$, and a set $\Omega = \{ 1, \omega, \omega^2,
\dots, \omega^{n-1} \}$ of powers of the primitive $n$-th root of unity
$\omega$. The &ldquo;Product Check&rdquo; is a succinct, interactive protocol which
allows a prover to convince a verifier of the statement &ldquo;$\prod_{a \in
\Omega} f(a) = 1$.&rdquo; It can be made non-interactive using Fiat-Shamir. This
product check is a key ingredient in both the Plonk snark and the Plookup
lookup argument.</p>
<p>To construct the product check, we define a polynomial $t$ of the same
degree $n$ as $f$. We define $t$ inductively:
[note this isn&rsquo;t actually an inductive relation and point 2 captures point
1 if you start with $s=0$ instead of $s=1$. Should fix this exposition]</p>
<ol>
<li>$t(1) = f(1)$, and</li>
<li>$t(\omega^s) = \prod_{i = 0}^s f(\omega^i)$ for all $s \in 1, \dots, n-1$.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that if the claim holds, we have an additional equality:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>$t(\omega^{n-1}) = 1$.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-recurrence-relation">The Recurrence Relation</h3>
<p>Directly from the definition of $t$ and from the third equation above, we
get that the following recurrence relation holds:
</p>
$$t(\omega \cdot x) = t(x) \cdot f(\omega \cdot x), \forall x \in \Omega.$$
<h3 id="the-vanishing-argument">The Vanishing Argument</h3>
<p>In addition to the polynomial $t$, we will use the following standard trick
to convince a verifier that some polynomial evaluates to zero on all points
in $\Omega$. Assume we have such a polynomial $h$. Assume the prover and
verifier also have access to some polynomial $z$ such that $z(x) = 0$ for
all $x \in \Omega$. Note that this polynomial is simply $z(X) = X^n - 1$
when $\Omega$ is the set of $n$-th roots of unity. Then, to convince the
verifier that $h(x) = 0$ for all $x \in \Omega$, it suffices to convince
the verifier that $z$ divides $h$ as formal polynomials. This is the idea
behind the following protocol.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vanishing Argument Protocol.</strong>
We assume the prover has a polynomial $h$, and both the prover and verifier have $\com(h)$.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prover divides $h$ by $z$ to get a quotient polynomial $q$ such that
$h(X) = z(X) \cdot q(X)$. It sends $\com(q)$ to the verifier.</li>
<li>Verifier sends a random $r \in \F$ to the prover.</li>
<li>Prover sends evaluations $h(r)$ and $q(r)$ to the verifier, along with
corresponding evaluation proofs.</li>
<li>Verifier computes $z(r)$ on its own. It accepts iff the evaluation proofs are
valid and $h(r) = z(r) \cdot q(r)$.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cost">Cost</h4>
<ul>
<li>(prover cost) 1 polynomial division of size $m$, where $m$ is the degree of $h$</li>
<li>(prover cost and communication cost) 1 polynomial commitment of degree $m-n$, where $m$ is as above and $n
  = \lvert \Omega \rvert$</li>
<li>(prover cost and communication cost) 2 evaluation proofs, one for $\com(h)$ and one for $\com(q)$. Can we
batch these somehow? (unsure b/c they are for 2 diff polynomials)</li>
<li>(verifier cost) 2 evaluation proof verifications and the computation of
$z(r)$.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-main-protocol">The Main Protocol</h3>
<p>Prover can commit to some polynomial $t$.
Prover needs to convince the verifier that:</p>
<ul>
<li>recurrence relation holds wrt committed $t$</li>
<li>$t(\omega^{n-1}) = 1$</li>
</ul>
<p>The product check uses the vanishing argument above. For clarity, we will
expand out the invocation of this subprotocol.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Product Check Protocol.</strong>
We assume the prover has a polynomial $f$, and both the prover and verifier have $\com(f)$.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prover computes the polynomial $t$ above, and sends to the verifier.
Prover also sends evaluation proof for $t(\omega^{n-1}) = 1$.</li>
<li><strong>Prover and verifier run vanishing arugment protocol to show
the polynomial $t(\omega \cdot X) - t(X) \cdot f(\omega \cdot X)$
vanishes:</strong></li>
<li>Prover divides $t(\omega \cdot X) - t(X) \cdot f(\omega \cdot X)$ by $z$ to get
a quotient polynomial $q$. It sends $\com(q)$ to the verifier.</li>
<li>Verifier sends a random $r \in \F$ to the prover.</li>
<li>Prover sends evaluations $t(r)$, $t(\omega \cdot r)$, $f(\omega \cdot r)$
and $q(r)$ to the verifier, along with corresponding evaluation
proofs.</li>
<li>Verifier computes $z(r)$ on its own. It accepts iff the evaluation
proofs are valid and
$t(\omega \cdot r) - t(r) \cdot f(\omega \cdot r) = z(r) \cdot q(r)$.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-important-variant-product-equality-check">A Important Variant: Product <em>Equality</em> Check</h2>
<p>We can use the same ideas to check that $\prod_{a \in \Omega} f(a)
= \prod_{a \in \Omega} g(a)$, for committed $f$ and $g$. This is equivalent
to checking the <em>rational function</em> equality $\prod_{a \in \Omega} f(a) / g(a) = 1$:</p>
$$
\begin{align}
& \prod_{a \in \Omega} f(a) / g(a) = 1 \\
\Leftrightarrow & \frac{\prod_{a \in \Omega} f(a)}{ \prod_{a \in \Omega} g(a) } = 1 \\
\Leftrightarrow & \prod_{a \in \Omega} f(a)  = \prod_{a \in \Omega} g(a).
\end{align}
$$
<p><strong>Main idea:</strong> instead of using the vanishing argument to check the
recurrence $t(\omega \cdot x) = t(x) \cdot f(\omega \cdot x)$,
use it to check
$g(\omega \cdot x) \cdot t(\omega \cdot x) = t(x) \cdot f(\omega \cdot x)$.</p>
<h4 id="cost-1">Cost</h4>
<ul>
<li>(prover cost and communication cost) 1 polynomial commitment $\com(t)$ of degree $n$</li>
<li>(prover cost and communicaction cost) 1 evaluation proof with respect to
$\com(t)$</li>
<li>(verifier cost) 1 evaluation proof verification</li>
<li>Vanishing argument costs:
<ul>
<li>(prover cost) 1 polynomial division of size $2n$</li>
<li>(prover cost and communication cost) 1 polynomial commitment of degree $2n - n = n$</li>
<li>(prover cost and communication cost) 4 evaluation proofs. <span style="color: orange">Is this right? Or is this only for the product check,
    not the product equality check?</span>
</li>
<li>(verifier cost) 4 evaluation proof verifications (batchable I think) and the computation of
$z(r)$. <span style="color: orange">Again, is this right?</span>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="plookup">Plookup</h1>
<p>The goal of a lookup argument is as follows. We assume we have two vectors
$(f_0, \dots, f_{n-1})$ and $(t_0, \dots, t_{d-1})$. We can commit to these vectors
by setting $\Omega$ to be the roots of unity of an appropriate size (to be
determined later) and defining polynomials $f(X)$ and $t(X)$ such that
$f(\omega^i) = f_i$ for all $i \in [n]$ and $t(\omega^i) = t_i$ for all $i
\in [d]$. Assume the verifier has polynomial commitments $\com(f)$ and
$\com(t)$. Then the prover wants to convince the verifier that for all $i
\in [n]$, $f(\omega^i) = t(\omega^j)$ for some $j \in [d]$.</p>
<p>In the following, we will refer to $t$ as the lookup table.
We also assume $d = n+1$; it is possible to pad $d$ while preserving the
statement by padding $d$ with its last value.</p>
<p><em>(Overloading $t$; should go back and change it in the previous section to
something else)</em></p>
<h3 id="the-products">The products</h3>
<p>Let
</p>
$$
F_{\beta, \gamma} = \left(1 + \beta\right)^n \prod_{i = 0}^{n-1}\left(\gamma + f(\omega^i)\right)
\prod_{i = 0}^{d-2}\left(\gamma(1 + \beta) + t(\omega^i) + t(\omega^{i+1})\right)
$$
<p>and let</p>
$$
G_{\beta, \gamma} = \prod_{i = 0}^{n+d-2}( \gamma(1 + \beta) +
s(\omega^i) + \beta \cdot s(\omega^{i+1})  ) 
$$
<p>
for some polynomial $s(X)$ of degree $n + d$. <span style="color: orange">Check
whether I haven't made an off-by-one error here.</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Claim:</strong>
If:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\forall i \in [n]$, $f(\omega^i) = t(\omega^j)$ for some $j \in [d]$,</li>
<li>The values of $f$ are sorted in the same order of that of the values of $t$, and</li>
<li>The vector $(s(1), s(\omega), s(\omega^2), \dots, s(\omega^{n+d-1})$
encodes the sorted concatenation of the vectors
$(f_0, \dots, f_{n-1})$ and $(t_0, \dots, t_{d-1})$,</li>
</ul>
<p>then $F_{\beta, \gamma} = G_{\beta, \gamma}$. On the other hand, if the
above three properties are not all true then if $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are
uniformly chosen from $\F$ (after $f$, $t$ and $s$ are fixed) then with overwhelming probability
$F_{\beta, \gamma} \neq G_{\beta, \gamma}$.</p>
<p><em>I haven&rsquo;t yet worked through the proof of this claim.</em></p>
<h3 id="using-the-product-check">Using the Product Check</h3>
<p>Assume the prover and the verifier have $\com(f)$, $\com(t)$ and $\com(s)$.
The verifier then can choose $\beta$ and $\gamma$ at random from $\F$. It
remains for the prover to convince the verifier that $F_{\beta, \gamma} = G_{\beta, \gamma}$.</p>
<p>We want to use the product equality check argument system above to do this.</p>
<p>If $d = n+1$, then we can define two polynomials $a(X)$ and
$b(X)$, such that for all $i \in \{0, \dots, n-1\}$,</p>
$$
a(\omega^i) = (1 + \beta) \left(\gamma + f(\omega^i)\right) \cdot \left(\gamma(1 + b) + t(\omega^i) + t(\omega^{i+1})\right)
$$
<p>
and
</p>
$$
b(\omega^i) =  \Bigl( \left(\gamma(1 + \beta)\right) + s(\omega^i) + \beta \cdot s(\omega^{i+1})\Bigr) \cdot \Bigl( \left(\gamma(1 + \beta)\right) + s(\omega^{2i})  + \beta \cdot s(\omega^{2i+1})\Bigr).
$$
<p>Then it follows that $\prod_{i = 0}^{n-1}a(\omega^i) = F_{\beta,\gamma}$ and $\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}b(\omega^i) = G_{\beta,\gamma}$.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: orange"> Issue:</span>
</strong> <span style="color: orange">It seems like we might need to use two
different sets of roots of unity. Isn't it the case that the product
equality check needs to work over a set $\Omega$ of size equal to the
product size $n$? Whereas $s$ must be defined over a set $\Omega'$ of size
$2n+1$...</span>
</p>
<span style="color: orange">
Thought about it, and yes, we need to use two different sets. This is
because if we try to use the same set $\Omega'$ for both defining $s$ and for
defining $a$ and $b$, it must obviously have size $2n+1$ to encode all of
the vector $(s_0, \dots, s_{2n})$. But this means that the equations above
only hold for half of the points on $\Omega'$. When we try to do a zero
test, this means that we only want zeros on half of $\Omega'$, and there
isn't necessarily a succinct vanishing polynomial $z$ which vanishes on
this subset of $\Omega'$.
</span>

<p>Regardless of the issue above (don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem to use two sets
$\Omega$ and $\Omega'$, we can use the product equality check w.r.t. $a$
and $b$ (which can be evaluated assuming we can evaluate $f$ $t$ and $s$).</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How many
evaluation proofs does the prover need to compute in order to do this
product equality check?</p>
<ul>
<li>3 to evaluate $a$ on a point</li>
<li>4 to evaluate $b$ on a point</li>
<li>2 to evaluate the accumulator (call this poly $\zeta$) on some point $r$ and $\omega \cdot r$</li>
<li>1 to evaluate quotient polynomial</li>
</ul>
<p>10?? Is this right? I thought Plonk only needs 7 or something.</p>
<p>I guess you only need to do one multi-opening for the 4 points on $s$, one
for the two on $t$, and one for the two on $\zeta$? So with this in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 to evaluate $a$ on a point</li>
<li>1 to evaluate $b$ on a point</li>
<li>1 to evaluate the accumulator (call this poly $\zeta$) on some point $r$ and $\omega \cdot r$</li>
<li>1 to evaluate quotient polynomial</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is correct, this is much better&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="more-questions">More Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>How do you compute a primitive $n$-th root of unity given a finite
field $\F_q$? What happens when there is no such root for an $n$ that you
want? I.e., do we have to round up, and does this cause nontrivial
performance overhead?</li>
